    INITIAL QUESTION (two)
Q2 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below method

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
local guildName = result.getString("name")
print(guildName)
end
]]

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
    -- This function prints names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members

    local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
    -- format the string before searching for it in case we need it
    --  for something else
    local formattedQuery = string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount)

    -- Execute the query
    local resultId = db.storeQuery(formattedQuery)
    
    -- Check if the query returned any results
    --  this will let us get an output so we know that something happened
    --  and in this case, no guilds matched our criteria
    if not resultId then
        print("No guilds found with less than " .. memberCount .. " members.")
        return
    end

    -- I imagine theres a very high probability in a mmo game
    --  that there will be more than one guild that has less
    --  than the specified number, so this will let us see all
    --  of those guilds instead of just one
    repeat
        local guildName = result.getString(resultId, "name")
        print(guildName)
    until not result.next(resultId)

    -- free the memory from the resultId
    result.free(resultId)
end

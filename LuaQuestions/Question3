    INITIAL QUESTION (three)
Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method

function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
player = Player(playerId)
local party = player:getParty()

for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
if v == Player(membername) then
party:removeMember(Player(membername))
end
end
end
]]

function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
    local player = Player(playerId)
    
    -- we can stop the function here if the player doesn't exist
    if not player then
        print("Player not found")
        return
    end
    
    local party = player:getParty()

    -- similarly, we can do the same for the party
    if not party then
        print("Party not found")
        return
    end

    local members = party:getMembers()
    
    for k, v in pairs(members) do
        -- instead of creating a new player each time, we can just check the names
        if v:getName() == membername then
            party:removeMember(v)
            -- also added a print so we know it actually worked
            print(membername .. " removed from the party.")
            -- we can also exit the loop once player has been found
            break
        end
    end
    
    -- After, we can check for empty party and might consider
    --  removing party from database
    if party:isEmpty() then
        print("The party is now empty.")
    end
end

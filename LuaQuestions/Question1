    INITIAL QUESTION (one)
Q1 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods

local function releaseStorage(player)
player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
end
return true
end
]]


-- first step to improving the code (and this goes for all of Q's)
--  is to fix the indentation

-- next we make a constant instead of using a random number
--  this could also be not a constant based on what you use it for
local STORAGE_VAL = 1000

-- Looking at this function makes me think it's one we would
--  want access to globally + we aren't defining a function
--  inside another function so we really don't need local
function releaseStorage(player)
    player:setStorageValue(STORAGE_VAL, -1)
end

-- I also added an else to check if the player doesn't
--  exist as I'm assuming when it returns true it's
--  telling the place in the code that logout was
--  successful, ie, we should also have an option for it to
--  be NOT successful
function onLogout(player)
    if player:getStorageValue(STORAGE_VAL) == 1 then
        addEvent(releaseStorage, STORAGE_VAL, player)
    else
        return false;
    end

    return true
end
